# Assignment 2: WordPress Themes

### This Week's Topic Notes and Lessons Learned

<p>This week we learned how to create themes in Wordpress. We learned how to create a parent theme, and a child theme. The child theme is connected to the parent theme by displaying the same post on our blog/website, and can even display the same code as the parent theme. However, the child theme can also be changed to look completley different than the parent theme entirely. This shows with my Eugene Krabs theme and my Spongebob theme. Both have a similar template, but have a different color scheme.</p>
